                    <p>
                        To challenge the competition, a unique and creative way to design the CanSat
                        and complete the assignment set was devised. The idea that was decided upon
                        was a powered landing from a drone. Due to restrictions with the small form
                        factor, the decision to use three foldable arms was made. This is how the CanSat
                        ended up with its three signature rotor arms, which lead to the name "Trident".
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The arms are spring-loaded and will be realized after deployment while in the air.
                        They are connected to the body of the CanSat through bearings that are
                        threaded over a metal rod. Following the deployment, the rotors will keep the
                        CanSat within a vertical velocity of 5 to 12m/s. The flight will end in a soft
                        landing provided by the increased thrust of the propellers. Due to limited space,
                        a creative way of making both the rotor arms and rotor propellers was needed,
                        However, with the sacrifice of the fourth rotor arm comes inherent stability
                        issues.
                    </p>  <br>
                    <p>
                        Three arms meant it was no longer possible to control the yaw. To address this
                        issue, a solution where the third arm could vector its thrust was put in place.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The design procedure was of iterative design, namely setting all the restrictions
                        of building it and making changes to the design features which did not meet the
                        design restrictions.

                        To allow for actively stabilized flight, one is dependent on a plethora of
                        components. The CanSat will have to be aware of its current position, rotation,
                        and altitude. it will also track how all of those values change over time. As a
                        result, one needs a lot of computing power, a simple Arduino won't be able to
                        keep up with all the computing necessary. This brought the team to use a
                        raspberry pi compute module 4 (RPiCM4).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        RPiCM4: This microcontroller allows for many computations to be done, while
                        still keeping a small enough form factor to fit in a CanSat. The RPiCM4 offers
                        plenty of General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) ports to be used for sensors
                        and outputs. The drawback of using an RPiCM4 instead of a smaller less capable
                        microcontroller is its power consumption. Therefore the team decided to add an
                        additional microcontroller to turn on or off the RPiCM4, for this an ATTINY85 was
                        chosen.

                        It is common to program the Raspberry Pi family of microcontrollers in Python.
                        When optimizing speed is required, programmers usually choose to write code in
                        C or C++. Trident ended up choosing Python for programming due to ease of use
                        and the ability to write multithreaded and multiple processes at once. It is
                        believed that by writing a slower program, Python, with multithreading, rather
                        than a faster program, c++, without multithreading, the program will run faster.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The sensors on Trident do not directly measure the rotation and attitude of the
                        craft. Instead, they measure the gravitational force on each axis, as well as
                        rotational speed and magnetic field strength on the same axes. To convert from
                        the read data to real-world heading and attitude, an Extended Kalman Filter
                        (EKF) will be used. This filter takes into account all the measured data and
                        converts it into three outputs, pitch, yaw, and roll. Instead of writing this from
                        scratch, python's Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) library will be
                        used.

                        The standard way of controlling drones, and the one trident uses, is using a
                        Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. The basic working principle of a
                        PID controller is the summation of three control signals, a difference (P),
                        derivative (D), and integral (I) of the device's position. It produces an output
                        steering signal that is capable of knowing what reaction the device has on the
                        steering, and applying that as gain or dampening of the steering.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        𝑢(𝑡) = 𝐾ρ𝑒(𝑡) + 𝐾𝑖
                        0
                        𝑡
                        ∫ 𝑒(τ)𝑑τ + 𝐾𝑑
                        𝑑𝑒(𝑡)
                        𝑑𝑡
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The K values are the weights of the P, I, and D, and each term is summed to
                        produce an output. Each weight will need to be tuned to produce the desired
                        output, where the drone is reactive but does not over-correct.
                        One PID controller is required per axis of steering. Pitch, yaw, roll, altitude,
                        latitude, and longitude will therefore require their own PID controllers. These
                        controllers will feed their outputs to three motors and a servo.
